## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

### 🔄 Can I add this mod to my existing Lost Cities world or server?

Absolutely! The mod can be added to existing worlds, though I recommend creating a backup first as this is still in BETA. I've personally tested version migrations (from V1.1.0-BETA to V1.2.0-BETA), and the mod seamlessly adapts without losing functionality.

### 💾 Why has my world folder size increased?

Starting with V1.2.0-BETA, the mod stores calculated data in a cache folder (`world/lcmultithreadingcache`). This cache can grow up to 500MB, but the mod automatically attempts to clean older data when it exceeds 100MB. You can manually clear this cache at any time using the command `/lcmultithreaded cache wipeDisk`.

### 🧮 Why does my RAM usage increase by ~100MB?

The mod maintains a memory cache for recently generated content to dramatically improve performance. When this cache approaches capacity, older data is either moved to disk storage or removed entirely, maintaining optimal memory usage.

### ⏮️ Will you make this compatible with older versions of Lost Cities?

Currently, no. Code differences between versions make compatibility challenging. While I'm considering future support for 1.21.1, I don't plan to support older versions as this would require using older Java versions - essentially requiring a complete rewrite of the mod.

### 👥 How can I help improve this mod?

I welcome community contributions! The best way to help is by reporting issues or suggesting improvements in our dedicated channel on the BlackRift Studios Discord server. Your feedback directly impacts development priorities.

Hey there! I'm Admany, and I created this mod to solve the performance issues I was experiencing with The Lost Cities. I co-founded BlackRift Studios with my partner ChaosCraft_HD, and we're working together to create awesome mods for the Minecraft community.

This mod is my solution to the lag problems in Lost Cities. I've written it from scratch without using any of McJty's code, which is why it will remain closed-source.

Big thanks to **McJty** for creating The Lost Cities in the first place - it's an amazing mod that just needed some performance love!
