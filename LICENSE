If the Software is hosted on https://curseforge.com, any bundled
distribution hosted on CurseForge is granted automatic permission to
include and distribute the Software, subject to the conditions defined
in this section.

4.2 Non-Commercial Classification Threshold  
A bundled distribution that includes the Software may be monetized
(including but not limited to advertisements, donations, or revenue
sharing) and shall still be classified as NON-COMMERCIAL if its total
combined download count remains below:

    100,000 (one hundred thousand) total downloads globally

The download count is calculated as the aggregate total across all
platforms, mirrors, launchers, and hosting services.

4.3 Commercial Classification  
Once the bundled distribution exceeds 100,000 total global downloads,
it shall be classified as COMMERCIAL, regardless of monetization method.

4.4 Licensing Requirement  
Upon exceeding the threshold defined above, the owner, maintainer, or
legal representative of the bundled distribution is required to request
a commercial usage license from BlackRift Studios within a reasonable
timeframe after being contacted.

Approved commercial licenses shall be publicly listed and verifiable on:

    https://blackriftstudios.com
