BlackRift Studios Software License Agreement (BRSSLA)
Version 1.4

© BlackRift Studios - All rights reserved
Founder: Admany


==================================================
OVERVIEW
==================================================

This Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs the use,
distribution, and modification of any software, mod, plugin,
library, API, binary, source code, or related material provided
by BlackRift Studios (“the Software”).

This Agreement distinguishes between:

1) End Users (players and individuals)
2) Distributors (modpacks, large-scale bundles, or hosted platforms)

The intent of this license is to protect intellectual property
and regulate large-scale commercial distributions. It is NOT
intended to restrict normal users or standard gameplay.


==================================================
PART I - END USER LICENSE
==================================================

1. Acceptance

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree
to be bound by this Agreement.

If you do not agree, you must not use the Software.


2. Permitted Use

End Users may:

• Use the Software for personal gameplay
• Use the Software in private or public servers
• Include the Software in modpacks below the commercial threshold
• Share the unmodified official version without payment
• Analyze publicly released source code for educational purposes


3. No Impact on Normal Users

This license does NOT:

• Charge individual players
• Restrict normal gameplay
• Disable features for ordinary users
• Interfere with small non-commercial modpacks

Enforcement mechanisms apply only to non-compliant
large-scale commercial distributions.


==================================================
PART II - DISTRIBUTOR LICENSE
==================================================

4. Non-Commercial Distribution

A bundled distribution (modpack or platform bundle)
remains NON-COMMERCIAL if its total combined global
download count across all platforms remains below:

100,000 total downloads


5. Commercial Classification

If a bundled distribution exceeds 100,000 total downloads,
it is automatically classified as COMMERCIAL,
regardless of monetization method.

This threshold exists to regulate large-scale usage,
not to restrict community creativity.


6. Commercial License Requirement

If the 100,000 download threshold is exceeded,
the distributor must request a Commercial License
within three (3) calendar days of:

• Exceeding the threshold, or
• Receiving notice from BlackRift Studios

Failure to comply constitutes a material breach.


7. Nature of Commercial Licensing

In most cases, Commercial Licenses:

• Do NOT require payment
• Do NOT impose strict financial terms
• Are issued to maintain transparency and record-keeping

However, in cases involving:

• Very large-scale distributions
• Significant revenue generation
• Corporate-backed or enterprise environments

BlackRift Studios reserves the right to negotiate
reasonable terms, which may include a revenue share
or profit participation proportional to scale.


==================================================
PART III - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION
==================================================

8. Ownership

The Software remains the sole intellectual property
of BlackRift Studios.

No ownership rights are transferred under this Agreement.


9. Redistribution Restrictions

Without explicit written permission, you may NOT:

• Re-upload the Software to unauthorized platforms
• Rebrand the Software under a different name
• Remove or alter author credits
• Present modified versions as original work
• Claim the Software or its systems as your own


10. Anti-Modification & Anti-Reverse Engineering

Except where prohibited by law, you may NOT:

• Reverse engineer the Software
• Decompile or disassemble binaries
• Circumvent obfuscation or protection systems
• Bypass licensing or enforcement mechanisms
• Modify the Software to remove attribution
• Create derivative works intended to replicate
  or replace the Software’s protected systems

Any attempt to bypass enforcement systems constitutes
a severe breach of this Agreement.


11. Copyright Enforcement & DMCA

Unauthorized redistribution, rebranding, code theft,
or misrepresentation constitutes copyright infringement.

BlackRift Studios reserves the full right to:

• Issue DMCA takedown notices
• Contact hosting providers
• Request removal from platforms
• Pursue civil legal action where applicable


==================================================
PART IV - ENFORCEMENT
==================================================

12. Blacklisting & Functional Limitation

If a distributor exceeds the commercial threshold
and fails to obtain a required license within
the compliance window, BlackRift Studios may:

• Blacklist the distribution
• Limit or disable the Software’s own features

Enforcement measures will:

• NOT crash the game
• NOT corrupt saves or worlds
• NOT interfere with unrelated gameplay
• Only affect the Software’s own functionality

The goal of enforcement is compliance — not disruption.


13. Anti-Circumvention

Any attempt to disable, modify, interfere with,
or bypass enforcement systems is strictly prohibited.


==================================================
PART V - GENERAL PROVISIONS
==================================================

14. Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.


15. Limitation of Liability

BLACKRIFT STUDIOS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE.


16. Termination

This Agreement automatically terminates upon violation.
All rights to use the Software cease immediately.


17. Amendments

BlackRift Studios reserves the right to modify
this Agreement at any time.

Continued use of the Software constitutes acceptance
of the updated terms.
